## Hi, I'm Alexandre, nice to meet you! And excuse me for my bad english, i'm yet studing...

### Here is a little bit about myself, graduated in systems analysis and development, also enrolled in an MBA in Software Engineering starting in June 2023.
I'm studying a programming language with a focus on Java, but I also have some experience with C#. Also, development tools like SpringBoot, JPA and others.
